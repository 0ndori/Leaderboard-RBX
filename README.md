# Leaderboard-RBX
you'll need to have a part with a surfaceGUI
in that surfaceGUI you'll need to have a frame
in the frame (rename it to PlayerHolder) you'll need to put the lua script written inside with a UiListLayout and add another frame inside
in the second frame inside the first frame (rename it Sample) you will need 3 textlabels
-Rank
-Username
-(YOUR VARIABLE NAME)
make sure to change that in the leaderboard script as well to set it as the variable of your choice 
you'll also have to set the variable value in the script
(it must be in the same order as the picture just simply change the name of the RebirthLabel to the name of the variable you putted in the script)
