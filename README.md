# Leaderboard-RBX

You'll need to have a part with a SurfaceGUI.<br>
In that SurfaceGUI, you'll need to have a frame.<br>
In the frame (rename it to `PlayerHolder`), you'll need to put the Lua script inside, with a `UiListLayout`, and add another frame inside.<br>
In the second frame inside the first frame (rename it `Sample`), you will need 3 TextLabels:<br>
- Rank<br>
- Username<br>
- (YOUR VARIABLE NAME)<br>

Make sure to change that in the leaderboard script as well to set it as the variable of your choice.<br>
You'll also have to set the variable value in the script.<br>
(It must be in the same order as the pictureâ€”just simply change the name of the `RebirthLabel` to the name of the variable you put in the script.)
